"""
Use -->
1. Increase Efficiency -> Reduce Manual coding and do tasks automatically, if we want to reuse the code or block of code then we can directly use it by using iteration.

2. *** It reduces Redundancy  --> reduces repetition of Code.

3. Dynamic -> handle dynamic data
Simplifies Complex task

4. Improve Readability

5. Scalability --> 
    a. large amount of data.
    b. any size of dataset.
    
6. Infinite Loops --> Ensure conditions are correctly set to prevent the loop from running forever.

7. Performance --> Be mindful of the efficiency of the loop when iterating over large datasets (e.g., using more efficient data structures or methods).

8. Control Structures --> 
    a. we use control structures in conditional statements 
    
    ex. 
    
    if condition:
        //code here
        break;  // when cursor hits break; it will not execute anything more in the code and directly come to the end.
    if-else:
        //code here
        break;
    else:
        //code here
        break;
    END***
