Here are some easy practice questions for type conversion and casting:

Practice Questions
1. Implicit Conversion
Add 5 (an integer) to 2.5 (a float). What will be the type of the result?
2. Explicit Conversion (Type Casting)
Convert the string "100" into an integer and add it to 50. Print the result.
Convert 3.14 (a float) to an integer. What happens to the decimal part?
3. Integer to Float Conversion
Write a program to convert 10 (an integer) to a float.
4. Float to Integer Conversion
Convert 99.99 (a float) to an integer. Print the result.
5. String to Integer Conversion
Convert the string "1234" into an integer and multiply it by 2.
6. Numeric to String Conversion
Take an integer 7 and a float 3.5. Convert both to strings and concatenate them with a space.
7. Boolean Conversion
What will be the integer value of True and False if converted?
8. Type Checking
Use the type() function to check the type of the result for:
Adding 10 (an integer) and 20.5 (a float).
Converting "42" (a string) to an integer.
9. Mixed Operations
Divide 7 by 3 and cast the result into an integer. Print the result.
10. Simple User Input Conversion
