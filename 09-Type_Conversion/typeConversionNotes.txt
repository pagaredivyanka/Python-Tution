Type Conversion - 
definition -> 
    Python automatically converts one data type to another data type without Manual/explicit interference. Also called Implicit type conversion(by computer it-self).

WHy used ?
    To simplify operations between differnt data types where conversion is safe (there is no data loss) and predictable. 

    integer = 100 want to convert it into float = 100.00  # there is no data loss.

-> (this won't happen in type conversion we need type casting for this )float = 65.87 convert it to integer = 65

Types of Type Conversion -

1.  Integer(int) to Float(float)
    -> integer = 100 want to convert it into float = 100.00  # there is no data loss.

2.  Float(float) to Complex()
