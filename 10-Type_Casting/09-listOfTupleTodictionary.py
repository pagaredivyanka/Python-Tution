Dictionary
    - A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
    - Each key-value pair is separated by a colon (:), and the pairs are separated by commas (,).
    - Dictionaries are unordered collections of items.
    - Keys are unique (cannot have duplicate values).
    - Values can be of any data type.
    - Dictionaries can be created using curly braces {} or the dict() function.
    - Dictionaries are mutable (can be changed after they are created).
    - Dictionaries are indexed using keys, not positions.
